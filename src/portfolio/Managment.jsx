            Portfolio management is the process of selecting and managing a mix of investments (like
            stocks, bonds, and cryptocurrencies) to achieve your financial goals. It involves
            deciding how much money to put into each type of investment, regularly reviewing their
            performance, and making adjustments to keep your portfolio aligned with your risk
            tolerance and investment objectives. The goal is to maximize returns while minimizing
            risk, ensuring your investments grow steadily over time.
